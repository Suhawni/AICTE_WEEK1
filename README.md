🌿 Waste Classification using CNN

An AI-powered web application that classifies waste as Organic or Inorganic using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.
Built with TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Streamlit, this project contributes to sustainability and waste management by promoting efficient waste segregation through deep learning.

🧠 Project Overview

This project leverages deep learning to automate waste classification. A custom CNN model is trained on labeled waste images and deployed via an interactive Streamlit web interface, enabling users to upload or capture images in real time.

The model predicts whether the given waste is Organic (biodegradable) or Inorganic (non-biodegradable), helping in automating the segregation process for smarter waste management systems.

🚀 Features

✅ Image Upload & Camera Capture — Classify waste from uploaded images or live camera input.

✅ Real-time Prediction — Displays predicted class (Organic/Inorganic) with confidence score.

✅ Automatic Preprocessing — Handles JPG, JPEG, and PNG (even with transparency).

✅ Interactive Visualization — Draws bounding boxes and labels using OpenCV.

✅ Custom UI Design — Clean gradient interface using Streamlit and CSS customization.
