Problem Statement: Inefficient Deforestation Monitoring

Problem Statement

Effective forest sustainability requires timely and accurate monitoring of forest cover changes. Traditional methods for tracking deforestation are often slow, require extensive manual effort, and lack the scale necessary to address the rapid environmental degradation of global forests.
The core problem is the need for an automated and scalable system to reliably and frequently detect, quantify, and visualise deforestation. This is critical for supporting conservation efforts, enforcing regulations, and accurately calculating sustainability metrics like annual CO2 loss due to forest cover reduction.
The goal of ForestVision is to create a web-based tool that overcomes these limitations by utilising advanced satellite imagery and AI.
